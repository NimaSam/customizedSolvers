# customized Solvers and libs

Here I share different solvers and library i cusotmized for different Projects


## Solver list
- driftFluxFoam (OF9)
  - Add RichardsonZaki relative velocity model
### Example
- particle settling simulation in pipe with driftFluxFoam
    - terminalVelocity
    - hinderVelocity: The settling velocity is calculated by multiplying the terminal velocity with the Richardson-Zaki hinder function.
